------
ESPKey is software which provides an easy way to type Spanish characters. It can be a preferable alternative to the built-in methods which require holding down the Alt key and typing four digits, or the international keyboard method, a single quote followed by a letter. This latter method can make actually typing a single quote inconvenient, since it requires you to be aware of the letter you are typing next, or just getting used to striking the single quote key twice when you need to produce a single quote.

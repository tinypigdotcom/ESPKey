ESP is a simple program that makes it easier to type characters
for the Spanish language.  Simply press control-' (single quote)
followed by one of the following keys to produce an accented letter
or other special character:

control-'	followed by	!	yeilds	¡
control-'	followed by	?	yeilds	¿
control-'	followed by	a	yeilds	á
control-'	followed by	e	yeilds	é
control-'	followed by	i	yeilds	í
control-'	followed by	n	yeilds	ñ
control-'	followed by	o	yeilds	ó
control-'	followed by	u	yeilds	ú
control-'	followed by	;	yeilds	ü

The key combination that triggers the special characters can be modified
if you wish.  In the text file ESPKey.ini which is in the installation
directory, change the sequence ^' to something else using the
convention (control keys)(key) where control keys are one or more of
the following:

^	represents the control key
#	represents the windows key
+	represents the shift key
!	represents the alt key
